However, many times, they do not bleed from hitting against something.</p><p>It’s not that there is no possibility, because wrestling is a dangerous thing. There is a possibility that people could hit against something and start to bleed.</p><p>Also, this is not restricted to matches, but in interviews or backstage attacks.</p><p>Many times, more so before the WWE went PG, we saw tons of matches where a wrestler would bleed. Now, it was not because they were hit so hard that the other wrestler busted them open.</p><p>Far from it, they actually cut themselves a bit before the match. Now, you may ask, if they cut themselves before a match why don't they bleed coming out to the ring?</p><p>Well that is easy to explain. Usually a wrestler will cut themselves just a bit above the eyebrow. They will get a small blade and make an incision just above the eyebrow if they know they are supposed to be busted open in a match.</p><p>This is called gigging in the world of professional wrestling. What will happen is, a wrestler will have a small cut above the eyebrow usually, their opponent will know where they cut themselves and really hit them in that spot.</p><p>Do they hit them really hard? No. They usually just have to hit them with their middle knuckle in the spot and they will bleed a good bit.</p><p>Depending on how much of a bleeder you are will be the amount of blood you will see. They cut themselves above the eyebrow because it is hard to tell there is a cut there to begin with.</p><p>In addition, if the spot they cut at has a lot of blood, the red stuff will be oozing and possibly get into their eye. And if they cut themselves there just right, the blood will not go in their eye.</p><p>Some cut themselves around the temple, and some cut right at the hairline on the forehead.</p><p>Ric Flair is one who is an ace at this. You can see just about any Flair match, especially late in his career. And eight times out of 10, he is bleeding. Sometimes he just gets hit hard and bleeds.</p><p>But many times, he gigs before a match.</p><p>There are accidents of course, and many times people will get hit to hard on something and bleed.</p><p>So sometimes gigging is not thought about. Because wrestling can be dangerous, people see someone bleed and think nothing of it.</p><p>Some people think it is real all the time, when many times it is not. It is actually planned to happen.</p><p>Since the WWE has gone PG, we do not see gigging much if at all. If a person gets busted open, it’s because it’s real.</p><p>Matt Hardy recently got busted open in a match with his brother Jeff Hardy. It was not televised but at a house show.</p><p>Jeff hit him with a chair I believe, and Matt started bleeding.</p><p>The wrestlers do not intentionally try to hurt each other. They know how to take chair shots, and they know when to do what in the ring.</p><p>The wrestlers do not try and hit each other so hard that they bleed.</p><p>They gig before a match, so that if they are supposed to bleed in a certain spot they can because of doing that.</p><p>Chair shots are one thing we see people bleed from. Just watch footage of them, and many bleed. But also many do not.</p><p>If they are, they will gig before the match.</p><p>This time, they usually gig right under the hairline on the forehead. Certain places get gigged depending on how they are supposed to bleed.</p><p>Chair shots are gigged on the forehead, because that is where a chair shot hits at.</p><p>Punches or kicks are gigged at the eyebrow, because that is where they are supposed to be hit at.</p><p><br>One example for gigging improperly is Mick Foley recently on TNA iMPACT. He was supposed to take a punch from himself and begin to bleed.</p><p>He had a bandage on his forehead, and it was too high. He did not cut right at the bandage, but at the eyebrow.</p><p>He actually had a camera in his face, and since I was watching on my HDTV, and TNA is in HD, I saw the cut he did on his eyebrow. I knew right away that he cut himself and was supposed to bleed.</p><p>He actually rubbed some of it on his face to make it look as if he hit his bandage and the blood was coming from there.</p><p>But you could see the cut, and where the blood was coming from—just above the eyebrow. He actually did a perfect cut, because it went around his eye and started going in a trail to the side of his face.</p><p>The problem was that the camera was too close because of the invention of HDTV.</p><p>Many times wrestlers do just as Foley did and rub blood on the face to make it seem more dramatic when it is fairly small.</p><p>You will not bleed to death from a small cut like that, unless you have low blood platelets, which cause your blood to clot, or if you’re a free blader. In that case you would not be wrestling.</p><p>It bleeds for a small amount of time, so you have to get out as much as possible while you do bleed.</p><p>So that is why it looks like it spreads around, when really it is the wrestler making it looks worse than it actually is.</p><p>Many times a trail will run down ones face. You have to make sure it stays out of your eye because it does not feel good when it gets in your eye. If you don't believe me try having blood fall in your eye and see how it feels.</p><p>There is a lot that goes into doing this. It takes a long time to learn how to properly do it. People think it is easy to just bleed. But when you get busted open for real in wrestling, you are in trouble because you could bleed to death easily.</p><p>Ric Flair got busted open for real when he attacked Chris Jericho before Wrestlemania. He lost a lot of blood because of it, and Flair being older, could not stop the bleeding as fast as he could when he was younger.</p><p>Age is a major factor. Remember that if you are older and want to try gigging out.</p><p>People do not realize what goes into wrestling sometimes, and they need to know.</p><p>I loved what the move "The Wrestler" did, because it did shed some light on this act.</p><p>Now this can be done during a match too, gigging is not restricted sometimes to before the match. This may seen contradictory, but no it is not.</p><p>There has been cases where a wrestler will cut themselves during a match, but it cannot be done in a singles match too often. Mainly because the focus on the wrestler is too high.</p><p>There was a case where Chris Jericho was in the Elimination Chamber match, a match with many opponents. He hit the ground while others were wrestling. A ref went to "check" on Jericho, and handed him a blade.</p><p>He cut himself then, but before he was fine with no cut whatsoever. He bled a good bit, and of course it was supposedly from a Pedigree or another move that was hit on him, at least that is what JR said.</p><p>The focus was off of Jericho, so he was able to cut himself without anyone knowing. So yes, it can be done during. But many times, it in the WWE at least. They like to cut themselves before in singles.</p><p>Depending on the match, you will know if they cut before or during. Remember to always look at the face, and you can tell.</p><p>You won't see much of this in the WWE anymore, but keep an eye on ROH, TNA, and other wrestling promotions.</p><p>Take last night's TNA Lockdown PPV for example. TNA had all their matches done inside what they call the Six Sides of Steel. Of course we know it is a Steel Cage match.</p><p>However, TNA loves to make a big deal out of things like that.</p><p>Many people who bled last night gigged a bit before hand. However you could not tell as easily, so TNA is getting better. Apparently they watched iMPACT.</p><p>Keep an eye out for it, and pay attention to faces when you watch wrestling. Because if you do you may be able to tell when a person gigs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaG5xYml9brPIoJ6ippditq9506GcZq%2Bfp7mlec6fZKmqn2LEs7HSraOippditLC7w2amq2WSlrE%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./nf-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Rapper Career Earnings Cars House Salary</a>
