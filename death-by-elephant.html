They were ordered, accordingly, to be thrown to the elephants, which had been taught to cut their victims to pieces. Their hoofs were cased with sharp iron instruments, and the extremities of these were like knives.</p><p>On such occasions the elephant-driver rode upon them: and, when a man was thrown to them, they would wrap the trunk about him and toss him up, then take him with the teeth and throw him between their fore feet upon the breast, and do just as the driver should bid them, and according to the orders of the Emperor. If the order was to cut him to pieces, the elephant would do so with his irons, and then throw the pieces among the assembled multitude: but if the order was to leave him, he would be left lying before the Emperor, until the skin should be taken off, and stuffed with hay, and the flesh given to the dogs.</p><p>While a straight-up head stomping was the typical method of execution, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">other methods of torture</a> were implemented as well, with some elephants trained to slice criminals into bits with the aid of blades fitted onto their tusks.</p><p>In nearby Sri Lanka, executioner elephants were said to use their tusks to stab their victims to death, while Thailand preferred its incarcerated to be flung like ragdolls before having the life stomped out of them. Perhaps the most inhumane was the Vietnamese method of tying criminals to a stake before commanding an elephant to charge them, crushing them into oblivion.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-99211 alt="Death By Elephant" width=900 height=477 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/elephant-stomp-rendering.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-99211 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span></p><p>With much more traditionally feared creatures available to deliver their justice, why choose an elephant to serve as executioner?</p><p>Well for starters, elephants are known for being highly intelligent and easily trainable. This trait allowed for the executing elephant to learn to torture their victims before eventually killing them, should their commanders so desire and some elephants have been said to answer to orders to break a criminal’s limbs before delivering the final crushing blow.</p><p>One of the earliest examples of the force of elephants used against man dates back to the year 220 BC, with the Carthaginian general, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hannibal</a>, at the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Battle of the Tagus River</a>. There, armed with the power of 40 elephants, Hannibal forced an army of 100,000 Celtiberian tribesmen to retreat from his advances for fear of being stomped to death.</p><p>Following the proven effectiveness of Hannibal’s “war elephants,” the use of the massive beasts would increase over time, from aiding in Hannibal’s eventual crossing of the Alps in the year 218 BC, to their part in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the creation of Angkor Wat</a> in the 12th century AD, where they can still be found giving rides to tourists today.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-98357 alt="War Elephants" width=900 height=477 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/war-elephants-hannibal-execution.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-98357 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span></p><p>Sometime between the 5th and 15th centuries AD, the use of elephants took a more sinister turn with the practice of Gunga Rao. Not only was the use of execution by way of elephant a feared and highly effective form of penalty by death, many believe the method was designed to demonstrate <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the all-encompassing power</a> of the area’s ruling emperor, for whom even nature was controllable.</p><p>The practice of Gunga Rao eventually died out <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">as the British Empire continued to grow</a> in power in many of the areas where the practice was once common.</p><p>Today, elephants, still as easily trainable and smart as ever, are still used for various entertainment practices, mainly as attractions in modern circuses across the world.</p><p>For more on animals-turned-weapons, read about the strange history of <a href=#>military dolphins</a>.
