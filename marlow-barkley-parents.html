The movie, Slumberland, effectively conveys the emotions that underlie our deepest wants and fears, which are reflected in our dreams.</p><p>With the release of the movie on the streaming platform, Marlow Barkley (Nemo) has gained huge popularity because of her performance at such a young age. Similarly, people have been interested to know more about her in detail, including who her parents are. Well, we’ve got you covered.</p><h2>Marlow Barkley’s Parents & Age: The 14-Year-Old Slumberland Cast Was Born on November 18, 2008, to Mother, Katie Barkley, and Father, Joseph King Barkley!</h2><p><strong>Marlow Barkley</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@marlowbarkley</a>) was born on November 18, 2008, to her parents, Katie Barkley and Joseph King Barkley. Her mother, <strong>Katie Barkley</strong>, and father, <strong>Joseph King Barkley</strong>, are both <a href=# rel=noopener>proud parents</a> of two daughters. Yes, she also has an elder sister named <strong>Tessa Barkley</strong>. Additionally, the 14-year-old star’s father is a principal consultant, speaker, and Executive Coach at Novus Global.</p><p>Marlow was up in Los Angeles, California, a hotspot for aspiring performers, and she too decided to follow her dream of being an actress. She was interested in art from a young age and started acting in community plays with her sister. They both played Anna and Elsa in the play Frozen Jr. No matter what, their parents do not hesitate to support their girls on social media, no matter how large or tiny their successes are; they are always there to show their love and admiration. The couple has continually pushed both daughters to pursue their aspirations.</p><p>Marlow began her career acting as a theatrical performer. She was a part in various performances, and because of her lively and jovial personality, she was given several funny roles to play.</p><p>Later, Marlow Barkley joined Kazarian/Measures/Ruskin & Associates,&nbsp;a <a href=# rel=noopener>talent agency</a> that helped her in breaking into the mainstream media; she started out small with a few roles here and there in series like South Park, The Loud House, and Fur-Ever Family. Fur-Ever Family was a short film where she provided the voice for the character Bitsy; it was her first time working as a voice-over artist.</p><p>With the ABC series, Single Parents, where she portrayed the part of Sophie Cooper for two years and appeared in more than 50 episodes, she had her big break in 2018. The series also featured talents like <strong>Leighton Meester</strong>, <strong>Taran Killam</strong>, <strong>Jake Choi</strong>, and <strong>Kimrie Lewis</strong>.

In addition to performing, Barkley frequently works with companies to promote their products on her verified social media account, including Lays, All Goodles, Mananalu Water, and a few others.</p><p>Since she had the opportunity to collaborate with Hollywood celebrity <strong>Jason Momoa</strong> in Netflix’s Slumberland, in which Marlow portrayed the character of Nemo, her reputation has been continuously rising. In the family adventure movie, a young girl named Nemo sets out on a quest in the hopes of running across her dead father once more. Nemo finds a hidden map of the dream world.</p><p>Nemo is the role that changed her life because it gave her the opportunity to work closely with well-known actors like Jason Momoa, <strong>Kyle Chandler</strong>, and <strong>Chris O’Dowd</strong>. This is an impressive movie for the young star’s career because it establishes a standard for her as an actress; she is only 14 and still has a long way to go. However, this is not the end of it because the exceptional young actress has already been cast in the lead role of Piper in the next movie Mouse Guard&nbsp;by director <strong>Wes Ball</strong>.</p><p><strong>Keep visiting <a href=#>Blurred Reality</a> to explore the</strong> <a href=#><strong>latest news</strong></a> <strong>about your favorite star.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianKq%2Fs7HDZqmemZyewbp6wqikaKWRp7mww4ybmKujnJrGbrzAq5ynrKNk</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jay-norvell-family-is-he-related-to-mike-norvell-are-they-brothers.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jay Norvell Family: Is He Related To Mike Norvell?
