He is a veterinarian from Greece.</p><p>He joined Pfizer in 1993 and has held various executive positions in the company’s various divisions.

Some unfortunately will get the disease,” Bourla said in an interview with “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Squawk Box</a>”.</p><p>The antiviral pills are “for people that already they get the disease. This is for sick people, the goal here is to prevent people from getting sick,” Bourla said. That’s where Covid booster shots come in, he added. “Boosters are needed because without them we will never get rid of this vicious cycle of the disease.”</p><p>Some people still experience harsh breakthrough infections and symptoms, and that’s where Pfizer’s new pill, if approved, would be most useful. “We need to get to herd immunity,” Bourla said.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Pfizer</a>&nbsp;said Friday its oral Covid pill, administered in combination with a widely used HIV drug,&nbsp;cut the risk of hospitalization or death by 89%&nbsp;in high-risk adults who’ve been exposed to the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">coronavirus</a>.

Merck shares fell more than 9% on the prospect of competition in treatments.</p><p>If cleared by U.S. health regulators, these pills would likely be game changers in the ongoing global pandemic fight. Pfizer plans to submit its data to the Food and Drug Administration “as soon as possible.” Bourla told CNBC, “We plan to submit before Thanksgiving holiday.”</p><p>The antiviral pill made by Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">was approved</a>&nbsp;by Britain’s medicines regulator on Thursday.
