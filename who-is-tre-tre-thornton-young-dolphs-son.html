Unfortunately, his father, Young Dolph, was tragically killed in November 2021 when Tre Tre was just seven years old.&nbsp;Tre Tre Thornton is sharing his childhood with a younger sister and together, the kids have been growing up under the watch of their mother after their father’s death.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Tre Tre Thornton’s Biography</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Tre Tre Thornton</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Male</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> 20th of June 2014</li><li><strong>Tre Tre Thornton’s Age:</strong> 9 Years Old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Mixed</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Gemini</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Single</li><li><strong>Tre Tre Thornton’s Parents:</strong> Young Dolph Thornton and Mia Jaye</li><li><strong>Siblings:</strong> Aria Ella Thornton</li><li><strong>Famous For:</strong> Being the son of Young Dolph Thornton</li><li><strong><strong>Tre Tre Thornton’s Instagram: @</strong></strong>tre.thornton</li></ul><h2><strong>How Old Is Tre Tre Thornton?</strong></h2><p>Tre Tre Thornton is currently 9 years old as he was born on the 20th of June 2014. The young American was born in Memphis, Tennessee, where he is spending his formative years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/06/Tre-Thorton-3-e1656006382160.jpg><p>The name “Tre Tre” is French and means the number three – an acknowledgment that the boy has become the third family member among the Thorntons. His nationality is obviously American but Tre Tre is of mixed ethnicity.</p><p>As earlier mentioned, he is the son of the late American hip hop rapper, Young Dolph, who goes by the official name Adolph Robert Thornton Jr. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Dolph lost his life</a> after he was shot 22 times in front of a Memphis bakery on November, 17th, 2021.</p><p>His mother, on the other hand, has been identified as Mia Jaye – an entrepreneur with the retail fashion brand known as Shop MoMeo. Mia is an alum of the University of Memphis where she bagged a B.Sc. in Real Estate Finance in 2012.</p><p>She has been leveraging her brand to embrace campaigns for several social causes, including #BlackMenDeserveToGrowOld and #BlackLivesMatter. The former was inspired by Dolph and her brother who lost their lives in similar circumstances.</p><p>Talking about his academics, the 9-year-old is currently in the process of acquiring his early education but the school he is attending has never been mentioned in the public space. This may be the family’s way of being security conscious given that the boy’s father was recently killed by unknown gunmen.</p><h3><strong>Is He Young Dolph’s Only Child?</strong></h3><p>Tre Tre Thronton is not the only child born to the late American rapper. Though his parents never exchanged their forever commitment, they lived together long enough to have two children.</p><p>Tre Tre is the first fruit of Young Dolph and Mia Jaye’s relationship. He was barely three years old when he became a big brother to the duo’s second child, Aria Ella Thornton, who was born on the 25th of February 2017. Aria is currently 6 and after her dad’s demise, fans were really sympathetic towards the girl who, according to them, would not be able to comprehend that daddy is no more.</p><p>Tre Tre Thronton’s baby sister surprised the public at her dad’s memorial when in her childish manner, she gave her deceased dad a touching tribute. Little Aria Ella Thornton recalled the fun times she had with her father playing around, the minor also said she will always have Young Dolph in her heart and will continue to remember him forever.</p><p>Aria’s future is just like a clean slate waiting for something to be written on it. She is yet to show interest in following in her dad’s career path but these are early days for her as she has her whole life in front of her. There isn’t much to say about Aria who is probably attending elementary school at the moment but the name of her school is not known.</p><h3><strong>The Young Boy Isn’t Showing Signs of Following in His Father’s Footsteps Yet</strong></h3><p>Considering his age, there is a lot we can’t say about Tre Tre Thornton just yet. The reason for this is that he is still a growing child. Things such as his career path, his aspirations, his passion, and the likes will have to wait for now; these can only be determined when he is a bit older.</p><p>With that said, we must acknowledge the fact that his late dad was somewhat channeling his interest in the performing arts before his demise. Recall that the youngster already made a couple of appearances in his dad’s music videos. The first time was in October 2018 when he appeared in the track, Shinin. Tre Tre would record his second appearance the next year in March 2019 on the set of the music video for the song By Mistake.</p><p>The next month (March 2019), news broke that Young Dolph’s first child would be launching his own reality show. The show which was called “Tre Time” was set to be aired via Dolph’s YouTube channel. Reports said the show would be following the Thornton brood as they all go about their day-to-day lives.</p><p>In addition, when Tre Tre Thornton was younger, he had his own handle on IG where fans go to get updates about the boy’s life. Though the account is still existing, there is not much activity on it. Since the death of his father, Tre Tre’s mum has become extremely protective of her children, thus, very little about them makes it to the public space.</p><h3><strong>What Was the Relationship Between Tre Tre Thornton’s Parents At the Time of His Birth</strong></h3><p>Tre Tre Thornton happens to be Young Dolph’s first child and according to some sources on the internet space, his birth occurred a couple of years after his parents tied the knot. However, there is a more believable version that claims Young Dolph and Mia never got married but they were live-in lovers for a long time.</p><p>In fact, the early part of their relationship was said to be rather unstable as the duo would always separate and reconcile. However, towards the end of the rapper’s life, their dalliance became more stable. According to Mia, Dolph was a devoted father to his children, adding that it was the rapper’s benevolent spirit and selflessness that made her fall for him; she stated this at his memorial.</p><h2><strong>Where are Young Dolph’s Children Now?</strong></h2><p>Since the demise of the American rapper, his girlfriend, Mia, has had full custody of their children. According to reports, the kids are growing up under her watch, which is expected.</p><p>The last time they made a public outing was at their father’s memorial when they gave him a heartfelt tribute. Tre’s speech revealed that Young Dolph left his only son with a lasting positive impact as he told the mourners how his father wanted him to become a good man. The youngster promised not to let his dad down by becoming “the greatest person” people will ever know.</p><p>Though their withdrawal from the public space has made it difficult to know what is happening in their lives, Mia has updated fans with tidbits about her children, saying that they are trying their best to move on after the tragic demise of their dad.</p><p>Via her socials, Mia shared that life has become different for her and the kids. Describing their lives as sad, cold, and suffused with tainted joy, Mia said Tre Tre and Aria are full of compassion. The children have been working hard to keep her cheerful and fill the hole created by their father’s passing. Mia Jaye counts Aria and Tre as her support system.</p><h2><strong>Key Takeaways About Tre Tre Thornton, Young Dolph’s Son</strong></h2><li><strong>Who is Tre Tre Thornton?</strong> Tre Tre Thornton is the son of the late American rapper Adolph Robert Thornton Jr., popularly known as Young Dolph, and Mia Jaye.
